Test the state and functinoality of your Octopus Deploy instance in Powershell and Pester. Uses the powerful `Octopus.Client` .NET library to make writing tests easier.

As your org relies on Octopus Deploy more and more as an integral CI tool, it can become hard to:
- Enforce conventions
- Perform care-and-feeding tasks (e.g. "Are there any deploys in Guided Failure or never had prompts answered last night?")
- Check compliance (e.g. "Do projects have this mandatory compliance step?")
- Check for corner-cases that can really be a headache (e.g. hostnames as IPs, missing DNS records, etc) that can throw a wrench into otherwise smooth deployments.
- Alert on business-critical "overnight jobs" that may have failed.

Some featured integrations:
- Supports alerting to PagerDuty
- Exports `NUnit` compliant XML through pester which can be consumed by your build server, e.g. TeamCity, Jenkins, etc.
  - **TEAMCITY NOTE:** The TC automagic Build Feature might throw an error. In this case, you might have to use the [service messages](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/build-script-interaction-with-teamcity.html) `importData` with `parseOutOfDate='true'`

# Setup
**Required Values** should be set EITHER as a(n):
- PS variable (`$var`) within scope
- Environment Variable (e.g. `setx`, `$ENV:`, TeamCity params, etc) 
  - Locally set with `.\devenv\Set-OctopusApiTestEnv.ps1`

## Environment / Requirements
Tested with:
- Powershell `5.1` (though Pester may work with PS Core)
- Windows + .NET 4.5+ (though one _could_ try swapping out the `Octopus.Client` to the .ENT Core version)
  - Right now the DLLs are hard-coded to `net45/*` in `packages.json`
- [Paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/installation.html) for dependencies, which `build.ps1` will attempt to bootstrap/locate by one of the (2) ways:
  - `.NET SDK 3.0` - will attempt to [restore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-tool-restore) the local tool
  - `.NET SDK 2.1` - will attempt to install the global tool
  - `paket.exe` in `PATH` - for example, you could add a [TeamCity Agent Tool](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/installing-agent-tools.html) and update `$ENV:PATH += ';%teamcity.tool.<installed_tool_ID>%` before execution.

It's very possible this might work with Dotnet Core and Linux/MacOS -- but it has not been tested.

## Required Values
 - `OctopusUrl`
- `OctopusApiKey` - [How To Create An API Key](https://octopus.com/docs/how-to/how-to-create-an-api-key)

## Optional Values
- `PdServiceKey` - The [PagerDuty Events API 1.0 API](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/docs/events-api) Integration Service Key. This is used when running the tests with `-Squawk`

# Build
1. Ensure the **Required Values** are populated in the session
  * [interactive sessions] You can use `devenv\Set-OctopusApiTestEnv.ps1` with a SPLAT value from your `$PROFILE` to quickly set values locally.
2. Run `build.ps1` and all dependencies will be downloaded/etc.

You can also filter a subset of tests using:
* `-TestTags @('foo')` - Filter based on specific `Describe` block tags
* `-TestFilePattern 'lifecycles*'` - Filter based on pattern appended to end of the path. The default value is `*`

## Special Pester Tags
* `noci` - will not be run by `build.ps1`
* `pagerduty` - used to denote tests that should go to pagerduty

## Sending PagerDuty Alerts
First, edit `SquawkPdMap.json` with the "matching rules" to the Pester Description/Context block names.
```
{
    "Describe": {
        "Context": {
            "PdExtraTest": "Please see wiki http://wiki.abccorp.com/p/12345"
        }
    },
```

Make sure you set `ENV:PdServiceKey`

Then run with `-Squawk` and `-TestFilePattern <pattern>`


```
 .\build.ps1 -Squawk -TestFilePattern 'PD_Squawk_AM_SEV1*'
```



**NOTE THAT**:
- Due to the way Pester runs tests, it's **advised** to use `-TestFilterPattern` which is usually set to `*` by default but will run ALL tests with such behavior regardless if their results are reported.
- `-Squawk` will use the value of `$ENV:PdServiceKey`
- Alerts will be grouped by Describe+Context block names
- **All** non-filtered, non-passing tests will generate alerts

# Development
The unit tests interact with the Octopus API using the *Octopus Client* .NET API Wrapper. You can see examples here: [Octopus Client examples in Powershell](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/OctopusDeploy-Api/tree/master/Octopus.Client/PowerShell)

## Setting Up A Local Environment
You **should installa local version** (with **matching version** to Prod).

https://octopus.com/downloads/previous

In your `$PROFILE` you can setup hashtables to make connecting to instances easier.
```
$octopusLocal = @{
    apiKey = 'API-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
    url = 'http://localhost'
}
$octopusProd = @{
    apiKey = 'API-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
    url = 'https://octopus.contoso.local'
}

```
Remember that you have to *reload your profile into the session* after any updates
```
. $PROFILE
```

Both `devenv\Get-OctopusRepoistory.ps1` and `devenv\Set-OctopusApiTestEnv.ps1` will accept these hashtables as a [SPLAT](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/reference/5.0/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_splatting), e.g.:
```
Get-OctopusRepoistory.ps1 @octopusLocal
Set-OctopusApiTestEnv.ps1 @octopusLocal
```

## Obtaining a "repository object"
1. Ensure you have run at least `build.ps1 -PreambleOnly`
2. Obtain a repository object
```
$repo = .\devenv\Get-OctopusRepoistory.ps1 @octopusLocal
# PsReadLine 'tab' keyhandler set to 'Complete' (unix style)
Î»  $repo.

```

## Pester
Tests are written in [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester/wiki/Pester)

## Design Principles
1. NEVER WRITE ANY DATA TO OCTOPUS
2. **Avoid** multiple heavy API calls (e.g. `.GetAll()`). Most of your tests should be in a "fetch once" and "iterate in memory" approach
3. **Avoid** `.Find()` functions as these simply iterate over entire sets using a delegate function to handle return output.

## Test Suite File Structure
Tests are structured as such:
```
tests\Octopus API Driven\
    {API Repoistory}.Tests.ps1
```
For example, tests revolving around the `$repo.machines` repoistory would be in test `Machines.Tests.ps1`

## Test Suite Layout
Tests are structured as such:
```
param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
    [string]
    $OctopusUrl,
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
    [string]
    $OctopusApiKey
)
#-----------------------------------------------------------
# init
#-----------------------------------------------------------
$basePath = (Resolve-Path "$PsScriptRoot\..\.." -ea 1).Path
. (Join-Path $basePath 'packages.ps1')
if(!(Load-PackagesJson -Path "$basePath\packages.json")) { throw "Could not load packages" }
$sharedState = @{}
$endpoint = new-object Octopus.Client.OctopusServerEndpoint $OctopusUrl,$OctopusApiKey
$repo = new-object Octopus.Client.OctopusRepository $endpoint
#-----------------------------------------------------------
# main
#-----------------------------------------------------------
Describe "Octopus Thing" {

}
```

An example of the `Machines.Tests.ps1` main portion looks like such:
```
Describe "Octopus Machines" {
    # Note 1 API Call
    $machines = $repo.Machines.GetAll()
    Context "Machines" {
        It "Should Have Machines" {
            ($machines | measure).count | Should BeGreaterThan 0
        }
    }
    Context "Machine Health" {
        foreach($m in $machines) {
            It "Should Not Be Offline: $($m.Name)" {
                $m.status | Should Not Be "Offline"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# Maintenance
## Updating Depedencies
1. Update the [paket.depdencies](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/dependencies-file.html)
2. `build\Update-PaketDeps.ps1`
